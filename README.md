#Dict Builder

A meteor application written in TypeScript and based on Angular2 and the project
[Angular2-Meteor](http://angular-meteor.com/angular2).

Since [Angular-Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) doesn't yet work with Angular2,
[Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/) is used for UI.
The original template is from Google, http://www.getmdl.io/templates/dashboard/index.html
